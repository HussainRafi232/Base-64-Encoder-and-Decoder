# Base-64-Encoder-and-Decoder

A basic simple and easy to use Base 64 encoding and decoding desktop application developed using C# Windows Forms on VS 2012. I actually developed it for myself since it was too tedious to give back and forth on online base 64 sites everytime for a task. This will save some time and effort.
